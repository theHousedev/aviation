Welcome to the CGI base homepage!

I am trying to build a useful collection of student and instructor resources here. This will include a collection of ACs and other similarly scattered FAA documents relevant to our operation, as well as guidance from manufacturers (Cessna, Lycoming, Garmin, etc) that informs at a deeper level if the reader wants to go there.

I've also got plans to create short article-style guides for multiple topics:
- How to brief an approach
- Chair Flying: The value of pretending at a world-class airline
- Building flows and running checklists
- Student's guide to the ACS

I'd also like to make a few deeper dives in some specialty knowledge areas for the curious:

- **Weather** pattern recognition & forecasting
- **Aircraft systems**:
    - Deeper engine knowledge
    - Electricity for pilots
    - Basics of hydraulics
- **Advanced systems:** Transport-category deep dive

If you find any problems with this content, please let me know and I'll fix them!
