I've got plans to create short article-style guides for multiple topics:

I'd also like to make a few deeper dives in some specialty knowledge areas for the curious:

- Weather pattern recognition & forecasting skills
- Aircraft systems:
    - Deeper engine knowledge
    - Electricity for pilots
    - Basics of hydraulics
- Advanced systems: exploring the way jets work

If you find any problems with this content, please let me know and I'll fix them!
